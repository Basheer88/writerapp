             Buzz Aldrin, both American, landed the lunar module Eagle on July
             20, 1969, at 20:17 UTC. Armstrong became the first person to step
             onto the lunar surface six hours after landing on July 21 at
             02:56:15 UTC; Aldrin joined him about 20 minutes later. They spent
             about two and a quarter hours together outside the spacecraft, and
             collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material to bring back to
             Earth. Michael Collins piloted the command module Columbia alone
             in lunar orbit while they were on the Moon's surface. Armstrong
             and Aldrin spent 21.5 hours on the lunar surface before rejoining
             Columbia in lunar orbit.''')
